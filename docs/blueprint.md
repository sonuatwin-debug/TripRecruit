- Use clean, simple icons related to job categories and company information. Icons should be consistent in style and easily recognizable.
- Grid-based layout to ensure content is well-organized and easy to navigate. Use white space effectively to avoid clutter.
- Subtle transitions and animations to improve user engagement without being distracting (e.g., loading animations, hover effects).
